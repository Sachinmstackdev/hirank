## CTA Design System

For consistency and brand alignment, all CTAs should follow these design principles:

1. **Visual Hierarchy:**
   - Primary CTAs: High contrast, solid fill
   - Secondary CTAs: Lower contrast, outlined or text-based
   - Ensure only one primary CTA per section

2. **Button Design:**
   - Rounded corners (8px radius) for approachability
   - Consistent padding (16px horizontal, 12px vertical)
   - Clear hover/focus states with subtle animations
   - Mobile-optimized touch targets (minimum 44px height)

3. **Typography:**
   - Action-oriented, benefit-focused language
   - Concise (3-5 words optimal)
   - Sentence case (not ALL CAPS)
   - Medium font weight (500-600) for readability

4. **Placement:**
   - Maintain consistent positioning (left-aligned or centered)
   - Ensure adequate whitespace around CTAs
   - Position at natural pauses in content
   - Ensure visibility without scrolling on common breakpoints

## Tracking & Optimization

Each CTA should have:
- Unique tracking ID 
- Conversion event in analytics
- A/B testing rotation for continuous improvement
- Heat map tracking to monitor engagement

## Mobile Considerations

- Increase button size by 15% on mobile
- Stack dual CTAs vertically
- Consider bottom-fixed CTA bar for mobile
- Ensure tap targets don't conflict with navigation gestures
