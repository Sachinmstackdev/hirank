# Welcome to My Blog!

This is my first blog post using **Contentlayer** with *Next.js* and *MDX*. 

## Why I Chose This Stack

1. **Next.js** - For its amazing developer experience and performance
2. **Contentlayer** - For type-safe content management
3. **MDX** - For writing content with JSX components

## Code Example

```typescript
const greeting = 'Hello, World!';
console.log(greeting);
```

You can even use React components in your MDX files!
